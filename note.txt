I've created a new branch 
run git add . and commit , it said "nothing to commit"
run push command > nothing to commit
then -->   git push --set-upstream origin jpII 
this will push all the file from the main branch to jpII

--------------------------------------------------
brand new repository:
1) git init  //after you run this command .git folder will be created in your local folder. Use ls -la to see .git folder
2) which files do you want to push? you may create any files in ur local drive by using command "touch <filename>"  or use  echo “# yourRepoName” >> README.md or any files in your directory
3) git status //check status of your local drive
4) git add . // add all file or  git add <fileName> (you can also use git add --all to add all files)
5) git commit - m “your note”. //** pls remember after you added something you need to commit
6) git remote add origin <your new repo url>
7) git push // follow the command what the terminal suggests
--------------------------------------------------
When you work on your own branch ….
git checkout -b <branchName> // create and switch to a new branch, still on your local storage
git push origin <branchName> // create remote branch
git branch // list all the branches name //press q to quite the screen
git add <file name> , or  ==> git add .
git commit -m “note”
git push
if you are working on your individual branch locally , “git push” will push the new files to your repo with no  parameters needed in the command line
if you run  git push --set-upstream origin <your new branch> , git will push all the files from the master to your new branch on gitHub.
  
Switching branch
git checkout <branchName>
Pulling files from repo:
git pull origin <branchName>
Deleting branch (additional):
1) git push origin --delete  <branchName>  //Delete remote branch first
2) git branch -D <branchName>  //Delete the local one
** note: you must not in the branch which you want to delete (edited)
